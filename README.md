   Since you found my code usefull and copied some parts from [here](https://github.com/TheKing-OfTime/YandexMusicModClient/commit/5384285a8de1101102fc21f593266807b38a304f#diff-c314348839e9fcfdd871cc449297e9cf3f9631701ff29758014ba11bf9200ba0) (more specifically PLAYER_ACTION event) and added it to vanilla client. You might want to hire me.
   My work will be much more efficient if I work on the source code in a cozy office rather than with a minified & webpacked version of the code
